Nice to meet you
Where you been
I could show you incredible things
Magic madness heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought oh my god
Look at that face you look like my next mistake
Loves a game wanna play
New money suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Aint it funny rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey lets be friends
Im dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I could make the bad guys good for a weekend
So its gonna be forever
Or its gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when its over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause were young and were reckless
Well take this way too far 
Itll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
But I got a blank space baby
And Ill write your name
Cherry lips
Crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses pretty lies
Youre the king baby Im your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
But the worst is yet to come
Oh no
Screaming crying perfect storms
I could make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like oh my god
Who is she I get drunk on jealousy
But youll come back each time you leave
Cause darling Im a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So its gonna be forever
Or its gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when its over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause were young and were reckless
Well take this way too far and leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
But I got a blank space baby
And Ill write your name
Boys only want love if its torture
Dont say I didnt say I didnt warn you
Boys only want love if its torture
Dont say I didnt say I didnt warn you
So its gonna be forever
Or its gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when its over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause were young and were reckless
Well take this way too far and leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
But I got a blank space baby
And Ill write your name
